# WalmartMobile

This is a research project for Walmart Mobile team, leveraging with Walmart public API at https://walmartlabs-test.appspot.com/

The features in the iPhone/iPad project includes:

1. I did not use any open source lib, so no "Cocoa Pods" for this project!
2. Pull to Refresh with animations
3. Infinite Scroll (auto-load)
4. Animated custom rating view
5. Parallax image header view
6. MBProgressHUD loading view
7. NSURLSession (NSURLSessionDataTask and NSURLSessionDownloadTask) to replace AFNetworking
